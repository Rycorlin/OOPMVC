# OOPMVC
This project was made using Java. It was made to showcase the use of OOP and make use of the Model-View-Controller design pattern. Model handles all the calculations and data while View displays everything you see. The Controller relays information between the two.

When running the program uses coordinates to determine the distance between the player and the enemies seeking to reach the player. These coordinates are updated every second and allow the enemy tacklers to move towards and try to "tackle" the player.

Running the program: You can run the program by using almost any IDE and running the MVCProject file inside of the controller that contains the main method.

Playing the game: You may adjust your characters icon by using the "Set your team" menu at the top of the screen. You may also adjust your characters speed and the speed of the enemy. The goal is to make it past the "tacklers" that are trying to stop you from reaching the right side(goal) of the game panel. Good luck!
